COrg is a C implementation of the Organya music format used in Cave
Story by Daisuke "Pixel" Amaya.

It currently does not support the Organya format, but will do in the
near future. It currently supports multi-track sequences compiled in
via music.h and uses the original sample file from Cave Story.

The end goal is to be able to play any Organya song from the command
line with full support for both drum and melody tracks as well as
panning and volume features.

Details of the sample file and the .org format can be found in
ORG_SPECS.txt.
