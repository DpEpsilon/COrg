orgsamp.dat:
All integer values are unsigned big-endian,
except sample frames, which are signed (2s complement).

1 byte: number of melody samples (100)
3 bytes: number of sample frames per melody sample (256)
for each melody sample:
   for each sample frame:
      1 byte: sample frame
1 byte: number of drum samples (28)
2 bytes: sampling rate of drum samples in Hertz at lowest non-zero frequency (2205)
for each drum sample:
   3 bytes: number of sample frames
   for each sample frame:
      1 byte: sample frame


*.org:
All integer values are unsigned little-endian.
A "click" is the smallest unit of time in an org file.

6 bytes: ascii string "Org-02" (or "Org-03" if the file uses percussion instruments only available in orgmaker 2.05)
2 bytes: "wait" value (the length of a click in milliseconds)
1 byte: beats per measure
1 byte: clicks per beat
4 bytes: position of the loop start, in clicks (the first click being position 0)
4 bytes: position of the loop end, in clicks
for each track:
   2 bytes: "freq" value*
   1 byte: instrument
   1 byte: 1 if "pi" checkbox is checked, 0 otherwise*
   2 bytes: number of resources
for each track:
   for each resource:
      4 bytes: position of the resource, in clicks
   for each resource:
      1 byte: note (0=lowest note, 45=A440, 95=highest note, 255=no change)
   for each resource:
      1 byte: duration (in clicks, I believe this is ignored if note value is "no change")
   for each resource:
      1 byte: volume (0=silent, 200=default, 254=max, 255=no change)
   for each resource:
      1 byte: pan (0=full left, 6=center, 12=full right, 255=no change)

*Even though orgmaker only allows you to edit these for melody tracks, percussion tracks also have this data, 
with the default values of freq=1000, pi=0.
I haven't tested to see if modifying these has any effect on playback.
